# DNA Classifier using CGR and CNN 

This machine learning project classifies DNA sequences as **Human** or **Non-Human** using **Chaos Game Representation (CGR)** converted into images, and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for classification.

##  Dataset

The dataset consists of DNA sequences sourced from public databases such as **[NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)**. These sequences are converted to **CGR images** that represent the sequence's genomic structure.

---

##  Methodology

1. DNA sequences are converted to CGR images (Chaos Game Representation).
2. CGR images are labeled as Human or Non-Human.
3. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on these images.
4. The trained model predicts the class of new DNA sequences.
